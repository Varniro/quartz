>Near the outskirts of Waterdeep lies the Crimson Forest, a place where sunlight barely penetrates the dense canopy. Long ago, a group of Ragnar's cultists made this forest their home, performing ritual sacrifices to appease their dark god. The blood of their victims seeped into the soil, turning the trees a deep crimson. It is said that those who enter the forest can hear the whispers of the tormented souls, and only the bravest or most foolish dare to venture within. Many who enter are never seen again, claimed by the spirits bound to Ragnarâ€™s unholy will.
