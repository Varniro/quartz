### Background and Lore

Ragnar the Blood-Eagle is a feared and malevolent deity who revels in chaos, bloodshed, and the dark arts. Once a mortal warlord of immense cruelty, Ragnar ascended to godhood through a series of horrific sacrifices and demonic pacts. His followers believe that he sits upon a throne of bones in the Abyss, surrounded by the spirits of those he has claimed through his vile rituals.

Ragnar’s name is whispered in fear and awe among cultists and warlocks who seek power through dark means. His worship involves brutal sacrifices, the summoning of demons, and acts of extreme violence. Ragnar rewards those who show unwavering loyalty and who offer the blood of the innocent in his name.

### Tales and Myths

> "In a time forgotten by most, there lived a warlord named Ragnar, whose thirst for power was insatiable. He roamed the lands, leaving a trail of blood and despair. Legends speak of the fateful night when Ragnar, driven by a sinister whisper, gathered his loyal soldiers and performed a ritual so vile that the earth itself trembled. As the last breath left his warriors' lips, Ragnar ascended to the heavens, a deity of blood and death, his mortal form forever transformed into a god of chaos and sacrifice."

>"Whispered among the darkest corners of the world is the tale of the Blood-Eagle. This dread ritual, a tribute to Ragnar, is a test of both skill and cruelty. The story goes that a young warrior, seeking Ragnar's favor, captured a noble knight and performed the rite. As the victim's lungs spread like wings, Ragnar himself appeared, blessing the warrior with unholy strength and immortality. From that day, the warrior became a legend, but his soul was forever bound to the service of the Blood-Eagle."

>"Silverhold, a city dedicated to Bahamut, stood as a beacon of hope and justice. When Ragnar's cultists laid siege to its walls, the citizens rallied under the banner of the Platinum Dragon. For weeks, the city was besieged, the defenders enduring relentless attacks and dark sorcery. As the walls began to crumble, Bahamut himself intervened, imbuing his followers with divine strength. The knights of Silverhold, now radiant with Bahamut’s power, surged forth, breaking the siege and routing Ragnar’s forces. The victory was hard-won, but it reinforced the city’s dedication to Bahamut and their resistance against Ragnar’s evil."

>"In a desperate bid to save his ailing family, a mage named Eldric turned to Ragnar, offering his own soul in exchange for their lives. Ragnar, ever eager to claim another soul, accepted the bargain. Eldric's family was healed, but the mage was bound to Ragnar, forced to carry out dark deeds in his name. Over time, Eldric’s humanity faded, replaced by a burning hunger for blood and power. Though his family lived, they eventually grew to fear the monster he had become, a tragic reminder of the true cost of dealing with Ragnar the Blood-Eagle."

>"Near the outskirts of Waterdeep lies the Crimson Forest, a place where sunlight barely penetrates the dense canopy. Long ago, a group of Ragnar's cultists made this forest their home, performing ritual sacrifices to appease their dark god. The blood of their victims seeped into the soil, turning the trees a deep crimson. It is said that those who enter the forest can hear the whispers of the tormented souls, and only the bravest or most foolish dare to venture within. Many who enter are never seen again, claimed by the spirits bound to Ragnar’s unholy will."
