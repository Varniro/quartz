Paladin - Subclass unknown - Kobold

P'mis was an orphan. He was always made fun of and bullied by other kobolds, calling him P'mis a lot. He wanted them to like him, so he adopted the name. P'mis states that his childhood was okay; he was always picked on a lot by his kobold friends, but that was just because they liked P'mis a lot. Then one day, their kobold hovel got invaded by bandits, killing all of them except P'mis because P'mis was useful.

P'mis was not strong enough to survive in this harsh world by himself, so he got sucked into a band of marauding orcs and goblins and served as their lackey. After some time, the captors came upon their roving band and killed all of them. P'mis begged for his life, saying, "I didn't know these guys, I was just here accidentally."

P'mis was taken by these captors, bullied until they were killed by big paladins in shining armor. The paladins, part of the Order of the Gauntlet, saw the small, trembling kobold and decided to spare him, seeing some potential. They took P'mis to Waterdeep, offering him a place to stay and food in exchange for menial tasks. Desperate for a place to belong, P'mis agreed.

In Waterdeep, P'mis performed various errands for the Order, his nimbleness making him useful. One day, while running an errand, he met a paladin named Sir Alistair. Unlike the others, Sir Alistair treated P'mis with kindness and respect, offering him guidance and mentorship. P'mis, intrigued by the paladin's honor and strength, began visiting Sir Alistair more frequently. 
Sir Alistair saw potential in P'mis and taught him the ways of the Order of the Gauntlet—honor, courage, and protecting the weak. P'mis, wanting to escape his past and just survive, tried to follow the teachings. Over time, P'mis trained under Sir Alistair’s guidance, though he never quite understood why people started looking at him like a paladin.

Tragedy struck when Sir Alistair was murdered in a surprise attack by remnants of the bandits who had once enslaved P'mis. The Order of the Gauntlet, recognizing Sir Alistair’s trust and belief in P'mis, decided to honor his legacy by offering P'mis a place as a full-fledged paladin. Confused and unsure why they chose him, P'mis accepted, feeling he wasn't truly a paladin but wanting to honor Sir Alistair’s guidance and memory.

P'mis, still bewildered by the Order’s faith in him, took up Sir Alistair’s mantle. Though he felt out of place and unsure of his worthiness, he vowed to uphold the values Sir Alistair had taught him. P'mis, once a pitiful kobold mocked and used by others, now stood as a paladin of the Order of the Gauntlet, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead in his quest for survival and justice in Waterdeep and beyond.
