Neutral Good

Backstory:

Silas grew up on the streets of Waterdeep, learning the arts of thievery and subterfuge to survive. He became one of the most skilled rogues in the city, known for his daring heists and ability to disappear without a trace. One fateful night, he was saved from a deadly ambush by your noble parents, who saw potential in the young rogue and offered him a new purpose. Grateful and indebted, Silas agreed to become a mentor for their child, teaching them the skills necessary to navigate both the shadows and the high society of Waterdeep.
