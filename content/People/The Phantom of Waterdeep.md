Rumors of a hooded, lean and impossibly fast serial killer have been making rounds in the streets of [[Waterdeep]]. From commoners at shabby inns to Lords and Nobles at the fanciest of parties, all walk with a sharp fear in their hearts.

No one knows who the next victim will be, there is no time to the killings, no pattern among the victims, no clear motive, the distinct thing being the iron rule the Phantom seems to follow - 

> Only one per day.

The party initially theorized that the various seemingly random killings have been organized by a group rather than a singular person. The killers have used different weapons and varying modus operandi for each of the victims that have been investigated by the party. This was later confirmed by [[Tad McAllister]] who told the party that each ward has its own Phantom and they are overseen by a different group. Below is the information known to the party since the latest session - 

- The group seems to be a Cult worshipping [[Ragnar the BloodEagle]] with the resurrection of [[Deepwinter]] being one of the goals of the group.
- The group uses *Giant* as the preferred language of communication.
- The group maybe to be involved with the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Black Hand]] to some extent.
- The group seems to also be aware of the presence of the party of adventurers investigating the Phantom.
- The group was previously believed to be operating out of the [[City of the Dead]] but upon investigation, only a small base with cultists worshipping [[Ragnar the BloodEagle]] were found, who were working under the [[North Ward]]'s Phantom.
- The only one killing per day rule seems to have been broken due to an unknown reason with three killings happening within the span of a few hours.
- Each Phantom has a different weapon and style.
- Phantom's may complete missions in other areas if need be.
