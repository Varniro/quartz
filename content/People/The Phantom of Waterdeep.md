Rumors of a hooded, lean and impossibly fast serial killer have been making rounds in the streets of [[Waterdeep]]. From commoners at shabby inns to Lords and Nobles at the fanciest of parties, all walk with a sharp fear in their hearts.

No one knows who the next victim will be, there is no time to the killings, no pattern among the victims, no clear motive, the distinct thing being the iron rule the Phantom seems to follow - 

> Only one per day.

As far as the current clues suggest the various seemingly random killings have been organized by a group rather than a singular person. The killers have used different weapons and varying modus operandi for each of the victims that have been investigated by the party.

- The group seems to use *Giant* as the preferred language of communication.
- The group seems to be involved with the [[Zhentarim]].
- The group seems to also be aware of the presence of the party of adventurers investigating the manor.
- The group might be operating out of the [[City of the Dead]].
- The Only one killing per day rule seems to have been broken due to an unknown reason with three killings happening within the span of a few hours.
