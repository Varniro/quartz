- A maid who worked in the mansion of [[Arne Hulina]].
- Was somehow working with [[The Phantom of Waterdeep]] who sent her missions and rewards in form of gold and jewelry.
- Seems as she didn't actually accept the rewards but still carried out her missions.
- Claimed to have found the dead body of [[Arne Hulina]], reported it to the guards and then packed her things and left the city mysteriously.
