Nobles from [[North Ward]]

Me and [[Dragur Moon]] once stole a golden apple from here

Dragur went missing trying to save me when escaping

Then, they were all found dead in their beds.

- The estate they owned deteriorated.
- Everyone that tried to buy it died mysteriously
- So after a while the government bought it and hasn't touched it since.
