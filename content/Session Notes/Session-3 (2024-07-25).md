- Upon knocking all possible doors multiple times and finding no answers, Clanger decides to break into the manor using thief skills he learnt from [[Silas the Shadowblade]].
- Making his way up the manor, Clanger ends up sneaking into the room of [[P'mis]], and finds him soundly sleeping in his large bed, still donning his armor and his sword by his side.
- Clanger decided to prank the innocent P'mis by sneaking near his bed, changing his voice to a loud and scary one and shouting "GOOD MORNING P'MIS".
- This surprised P'mis who was already very afraid of the Phantom secretly attacking him at night and thus P'mis let out a high pitched disorienting scream proceeded to make a deadly attack towards Clanger.
- Clanger managing to dodge out of the attack calmed P'mis down who was now very angry at Clanger, warned about never again trespassing into his room and chased Clanger out of his room.

### Session Starts

- [[Shoa]] makes some eggs for himself and [[P'mis]] and asks [[Clanger Agundar]] if he wants any breakfast, also stating that he will have to pay to eat.
- Clanger orders some buttered corn, which Shoa quickly and nicely prepares them, Clanger pays up and eats the corn while waiting for P'mis.
- P'mis finally comes back after 3 hours and says his day is ruined and he is taking a day off from the investigation.
- Clanger tries to ignite the fire in P'mis citing the need for justice and protecting the innocent civilians of the city of [[Waterdeep]]. But P'mis doesn't budge.
- Finally giving up, Clanger asks Shoa for the day's newspaper so he can get info on today's murder and see if a new lead can be found, and sure enough the fifth murder has taken place.
- A merchant by the name of [[Arne Hulina]] was found burned to death in the fireplace of their own home located in the [[Southern Ward]]. Marking the first murder of the Southern Ward. Clanger decides to leave to investigate the murder, seeing him leave [[P'mis]] also finally decides to join him saying that his day is already ruined and he can't relax properly now.
- [[Shoa]] decides to take a detour to the [[Woodcutting Guild]] to collect the payment for his furniture that he put up to sale and meet up with the party at the crime scene.
- At the crime scene, the party is stopped by a guard, who is then persuaded by the party to be let in, after successfully doing so Clanger decides to ask the guard questions about what their investigation he uncovered.
- The guard tells the party that the body was discovered by the maid of the manor when she came in the morning to do her work, she was terrified and immediately called the guards.
- He also told the party that the victim was actually first killed with a "Fire-Poker" in his bedroom then his dead body thrown into the fireplace set ablaze for some unknown reason, this was the most different murder till date connecting to the Phantom.
- Upon investigation of the crime Scene, [[Shoa]] finds a small wooden box with a letter inside it along with a pair of beautiful blood-ruby earrings.
- The party quickly makes the connection back to the maid being a prime suspect and rushes to the guard, who informs them the maid's name was [[Mary]] who seems to have disappeared after reporting the crime.
- The party finds her address from the public records that the guard has and quickly reach her home only to be told by the neighbors that she packed up everything and left in a hurry few hours ago.
- Understanding that tracking her down now is not possible, the party decides to investigate her home in the presence of the city guards and break into her home.
- The home was cleaned empty except a very similar wooden box found at the crime scene, inside which was a letter containing the name "[[Arne Hulina]]" written in blood along with 10 GP.
- [[Mary]] while seemed to have obeyed the commands on the [[The Phantom of Waterdeep]], didn't accept any of the payment for unknown reasons.
- Again, out of leads, the party decides to return to [[The Yawning Portal Inn]] to once again reach out to [[Lady Evelyne Blackthorne]] and check upon her being the first and only person ever to receive a threat from [[The Phantom of Waterdeep]].
- Upon reaching the inn, she was nowhere to be found, the innkeeper informed the party, that she died when her manor in the [[North Ward]] mysteriously collapsed one day out of no where.
- The party putting two and two together realized that her manor for some reason was built on top of the Temple of [[Ragnar the BloodEagle]].
- The innkeeper upon [[Clanger Agundar]]'s interrogation revealed that no clues had been found about the robbery at the inn other then a mysterious **Oak Leaf**.
- Stumped again the party decides to look at the spots the murders have happen and realize that when joined together the spots form a very rough pentagram ritual star.
- ![[Pasted image 20240726152128.png]]
- The party decides to check the center of the Pentagram just in case, and upon reaching the center of the Pentagram they discover a shop with a plaque containing the name "[[Penelope Titlivlus]]".
- Clanger recognizing the surname as a *Devil* surname gets alerted, but decides that it has to be a mistake as no devil would be allowed to open a shop in the middle of [[Trades Ward]].

> [!NOTE]
> - At this point Voice, Shoa and Wilgo go on a spiral rant about how this plot is very similar to Baldur's Gate 3 for about 17 hours and as they are just openly talking about potential spoilers, Varniro decides to remove his headphone and wait for them to finish.

- [[Shoa]] casts *Detect Magic* on the shop and detects multiple magical items in the shop, many of them emanating a cursed aura.
- [[P'mis]] uses his *Divine Sense* and senses the presence of a minor fiend coming from inside the shop.
- The party decides to carefully enter the shop, [[Clanger Agundar]] asks to the shopkeeper about the shop and items she sells. She openly says that she sells cursed magical items and that she is a devil, surprised by the Clanger asks for any formal documents she might have for the shop.
- [[Penelope Titlivlus]] furnishes her trade permit duly approved by the [[Trades Ward]] and the city of [[Waterdeep]]. She explains that she helped the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] long ago and ran away from the 9 hells and thus got permission to stay in the city.
- While her interrogation [[Shoa]]'s eyes end up on a specific magic item which demands the user's soul as payment. Shoa asks Clanger if he wants to give away his soul to which Clanger says no.
- [[Penelope Titlivlus]] also mentions that she knows about the Phantom's activity, and has seen people going in and out of the tomb of [[Deepwinter]], she also says that the owner of her neighboring candle shop has been missing for a few days and also goes in and out of the tomb.
- [[Clanger Agundar]] tells her that she might be the next victim of the Phantom and asks her to come with them to the manor so they can try and keep her safe, Penelope agrees however weirdly suggests they should first checkout her neighbor.
- Taking their leave from the shop, [[P'mis]] voices his concerns regarding her being a devil to the party and states that dealing with devils is not wise as they always lie and deceive people, and says instead of breaking into an innocent person's shop we should find more information first.
- The party reaches the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] and asks about [[Penelope Titlivlus]] who tell the party that the devil helped save innocent children and escaped hell, thus the order helped her get settled in the city and trusts her.
- [[P'mis]] still not convinced decides that we should get an official search warrant instead of breaking into the candle shop. Thus the party decides to split up to prepare to infiltrate the candle shop.
- [[Shoa]] decides to get some new locks installed throughout the [[Trollskull Manor]] to increase its security after the morning incident with Clanger and P'mis.
- [[P'mis]] goes to get some anti-devil doors and locks for his personal room as he is very afraid by the prospect of a devil living in the manor along with them.
- [[Clanger Agundar]] goes to the guard HQ to get an official search warrant for the candle shop and also collect any other information the guards may have about the case, to which the guards say no but do give Clanger a search warrant.
- Finally the party enters the candle shop, and finds nothing but candle of varying shape sizes and color everywhere. [[Shoa]] casts *Detect Magic* and finds out one of the candles has some kind of magical but harmless property.
- Clanger picks up this candle and a secret passage open into one of the walls of the shop. The party descends into the secret passage only to discover old ruined catacombs with seemingly empty but open empty rooms.
- While exploring the catacombs, a corridor with a section covered in roots becomes an obstacle for the party particularly [[P'mis]] who decides to take a different route.
- While Shoa simple jumps and Clanger decides to do a fancy wall run and a backflip, barely managing to make the jump. [[Shoa]] while exploring the catacombs finds a [[Bag of Holding]], which was a very sought after treasure for [[Shoa]].
- [[Shoa]] decides to go with [[P'mis]] and in an empty room they find a lone lantern, while magical it didn't seem to be cursed and ended up being a [[Lantern of Revealing]].
- The party then meets up with [[P'mis]] who used an alternate route and then discover a room with a single skeleton in it. Quickly dispatching the skeleton, the party sees a golden black ring around one of its finger emanating a very cursed aura, [[Clanger Agundar]] suggest breaking off the hand of the skeleton and putting the entire hand into the [[Bag of Holding]]so that the ring can be investigated without touching it.
- Continuing forward, the party discovers a room shallowly flooded with water. Even though the water is shallow a fish seems to be swimming in it, [[Shoa]] quickly casts *Speak with Animals* on the fish who confirms that it was spawned in the water and that there is no danger in the water.
- [[Shoa]] finds some gold pieces around the water and collects them, Clanger still wanting to hone his acrobatics skills tries yet again wall run and barely makes it.
- Clanger discovers a [[Tome of Leadership and Influence]] and gives it to [[P'mis]] who might be able to use it along with his paladin powers.
- Exploring the catacombs further and carefully the party comes across a room with 3 cultists, who havent yet noticed the party. The party decides to see if there are alternate routes available.
- While looking for a different route, the party comes across 4 cultist performing a summoning ritual, before the party can react, the ritual completes giving rise to a devil who quickly dispatches its summoners.
- The party launches an attack against the devil seeing it as an immediate threat. Initially the party does well, but as the devil sees it opportunity, it unleashes a lethal attack upon [[Shoa]] instantly killing him.
- Seeing this [[P'mis]] is enraged and his [[Bahamut's Fang]] shines with enormous power, P'mis swings his sword with full force killing the devil who turns into ash.
- As the devil dies two great gates behind him open a golden shining light shines through, Clanger picks up Shoa's body and rushes towards the light.
- The next room contains two scrolls of revivify and a Golden shining plate armor. P'mis quickly uses the scroll on Shoa reviving him. As the situation calms down, P'mis looks at the armor and immediately feels the aura of [[Sir Alistair]] coming from it.
- P'mis decides to take the armor which turns out to be a [[Plate of Knight's Fellowship]]. With [[Sir Alistair]]'s Spirit somehow attached to it.
- P'mis also heals Shoa and the party continues to defeat the other cultists, who easily surrender and are quickly gagged by the party because of their previous experience.
- The cultists seemed to be guarding a prisoner who was also a cultist, who was also gagged by the party. All the cultists were finally taken to the Guard HQs to be cleansed of the curse so they could be interrogated.
- The party decided to take Shoa back to the manor and rest up for the day after the battle.

### Post Session

- The next day [[Clanger Agundar]] goes to the parliament to find his party in deep discussion about the new law to be passed today about increasing taxes in [[Dock Ward]] to fund new public projects.
- [[Julius Margaster]] also warns [[Clanger Agundar]] about new information that he has about [[The Phantom of Waterdeep]] and its connection to the 
- While [[The Dawn of Freedom Party]] and the allies disagree, they are in the minority and they need to do something before the parliament starts.
- Taking the responsibility of talking to the neutral swing parties on himself, Clanger quickly gathers the attention of neutral parties in discussion and convinces them that raising taxes in wards like the [[Trades Ward]] and the [[Sea Ward]] would be more profitable.
- With Clanger's wits, Julius's Charisma and the support of the now convinced neutral parties the taxes were raised in the [[Sea Ward]] and [[Trades Ward]] and not the [[Dock Ward]].
- Julius at this point tells Clanger that he suspects that one of the MPs from the [[Traditionalist Party]] maybe also one of the Phantom or at least closely related.
- After the parliament end, Clanger decides to head back to his office, in the [[Dock Ward]] only to find it on fire. With many other MPs and officials of Dock Ward still trapped inside.
- Making use of his agility Clanger climbs to buildings and helps trapped people get out from the roof of the building and escape, and use his booming voice to sound a siren like voice to make other people aware who finally put out the fire.
- Julius also arrives at the scene and helps with the first aid and evacuation of the people, while Clanger tries his best to recover all the burnt documents using his expert forgery and observant skills.
- Clanger swiftly goes to the hospital after securing the office building to check up on his peers, no one was harmed at major levels, but this was definitely a deliberate attack.
- Julius tell Clanger that he suspects, the [[Traditionalist Party]] did this as a warning to Clanger for interfering with their plans today in the parliament and probably see Clanger as a major threat with his rising popularity.
- Julius and Clanger then go to Julius's office in the parliament building which upon Clanger's inquiry is said to be by Julius as a very secure place enchanted with anti-eavesdropping spells by [[Savra]] themself.
- Julius and Clanger then talk about a multitude of topics including his past as a paladin of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], his role in rescuing [[Penelope Titlivlus]] from hell and showing her kindness after killing her master and how he completely trusts her.
- Julius also offers Clanger some [[Dragon Juice]] which turns out to be Clanger's favorite drink.
- When talking about [[Penelope Titlivlus]], Julius asks Clanger if he has a safe place to hide, her, to which Clanger answers with his two possible options being the Manor of House Agundar or the [[Trollskull Manor]].
- Julius then tells Clanger that he has a secret magical hideout in the Dock Ward, which ha can use to keep Penelope safe, the location, being in one of the most rotten and forgotten places, which is due to the fact that it has to be secret. Between "Eagle Street 6 and 8, there is no 7. But if you blink 7 times in a row quickly it will appear. It is a multi-story building, that you can do whatever you want with."
- When Clanger asks if Penelope would be safer which Julius, he replies in no as he too has many enemies.
- Clanger then asks about the mysterious connection of [[Lady Evelyne Blackthorne]] with the Cult of [[Ragnar the BloodEagle]], to which, Julius replies that she is not working with the cult and has a high possibility of being kidnapped by the cult or the Phantoms.
- Julius also informs Clanger about a satchel belonging to [[Sir Alistair]] has been found in ruins around [[The Crimson Forest]]. And that it contains clues towards solving a particular mystery which Clanger should also keep an eye out for.
- Finally, taking his leave Julius and Clanger both express their appreciation for each other, while leaving, Julius offers Clanger with a [[Bag of Holding]] containing 5 PP and 5 Rubies worth 50 GP each, as funds for Clanger's adventure.
- Before leaving, Clanger asks Julius if he knows any possible use of Devil Ash that Clanger collected from the Devil he fought in the catacombs below the [[Trades Ward]], to which Julius replies, only 2, either summon another devil, or perhaps enchant a weapon.
- With a spark in his eyes, Clanger bids farewell to Julius and heads for the Church of [[Mr. Mozzarella]]. Where he asked a priest to bless his the rubies he had just received as he intends to use them make his bow stronger.
- With the blessed rubies, he heads to the guild hall to the [[Guild of Magic Weapons]] and asks for their best smith for some work, The guild introduces [[Killian Morden]], who tells Clanger that they can definitely perform the enchantment but it could cost their life.
- Clanger wishes the smith luck who begins the work, and after a short while the noises from the inside stop, when other people go and check on smith, they find Killian dead and the Bow radiating with energy.
- Clanger worriedly picks up both the bow and the body of Killian along with other guild members and rushes to the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] whose temple is nearby and urges them to revive him.
- The clerics their inform Clanger that it feels like the soul of the victim is trapped and is unable to come back, just then the bow seeming telepathically tells Clanger "Behind you!".
- As Clanger turns around he sees one of the guild's member that came to the order with them transforming into a devil and killing Clanger in one swift blow, with his dying breath Clanger shouts "Capture it alive".
- Once Clanger is brought back to life he finds the demon captured alive by the Paladins and Clerics of the order, seizing the moment and understanding the situation, Clanger decides to change his voice the voice of the demon they fought in the Catacombs and in perfect *Infernal* talk to the devil as a bluff pretending to be a devil.
- Clanger is able to persuade the Devil into releasing the soul of the smith and also able to get information about the Pentagram over the city in the center of which [[Penelope Titlivlus]] or "The Traitor" as worded by the devil is who will soon be dealt with.
- Understanding the risk he is taking, Clanger decides to end his cover and tell the Paladins to kill the devil and revive Killian who finally comes to life as the devil turns to ashes.
- The commotion of a Devil somehow being present inside the temple of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] surprised everyone including [[Savra]].
- Clanger approaches Savra and apologizes to her for the troubles and also asks her to take care of Killian as they have been through a lot mentally and physically.
- Savra is very nonchalant about the situation, when Clanger tell her about [[Penelope Titlivlus]] and the other information he has found, Savra affirms that the order will do its best to protect the city and also help protect Penelope.
- Taking his leave from the order, Clanger exhausted with the day he has had, decides to go take a stroll by the [[Alteka Family]]'s Manor and reminisce about the old days.
- While their suddenly something that was never in the ruins take his notice, a piece of cloth that belonged to the old jacket [[Dragur Moon]] always used to wear with fresh blood on it, a trail of blood leading to wall with a note saying "If the one and only true friend I had sees this, please try and find me. I don't have much time to write, and I don't know where they will take me. Please save me - Dragur Moon"
- Some pieces of hair are attached to the note, which Clanger takes and swiftly goes back to the order to find [[Bob the Wizard]] and cast *Scrying* on the hair.
- Bob tells Clanger that he sees a dark forest with a canopy so thick no light penetrates to the ground, several dark figures happily dancing in the distance and man help captive.
- Realizing that the location can only be [[The Crimson Forest]], Clanger makes a rush for [[Trollskull Manor]] to collect [[P'mis]] as he know he will need all the help he can get.
