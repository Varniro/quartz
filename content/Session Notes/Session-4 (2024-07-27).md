- [[Clanger Agundar]] comes running to the [[Trollskull Manor]] to ask [[P'mis]] for help regarding rescuing [[Dragur Moon]] from the [[The Crimson Forest]].
- Just as Clanger reaches the manor, P'mis just having recevied the satchel that once belonged to his mentor [[Sir Alistair]], opens it and finds a diary.
- The diary's pages are filled with the memories of [[Sir Alistair]] from a young age, and go on to his days as mentor mentioning many of his students.
- The diary mentions that [[Sir Alistair]] for some reason started looking for the location of [[The Grand Temple]] in the [[The Crimson Forest]], along with the diary a few maps are also present in the satchel of parts of the Crimson Forest.
- The diary finally says "I believe to have found the cultist base, I shall take P'mis with me at some point and defeat them."
- Just as P'mis finished reading through the diary, Clanger arrives at the manor and explains the situation quickly, and asks for P'mis's help who instantly agrees.
- Before leaving for [[The Crimson Forest]], they decide to confer with [[Shoa]] who is still recovering from his resurrection, about any tips he might have about navigating the forest.
- Shoa tells the both of them, to always stay on the roads and move in one direction, other then that, the forest is ever changing and mystical.
- Clanger P'mis then decide to leave for the Crimson Forest and find a fork in the road, with one sign pointing to [[The Golden Forest]], and the other to [[The Crimson Forest]].
- Upon entering the forest, they are encountered with a peculiar and strange noises, and an uncanny darkness. Moving further in, the both of them get ambushed by 3 Cultists and an Orc, which P'mis recognizes to be one the Orc that invaded his hovel.

- After defeating the cultists P'mis and Clanger continue further into the forest but get lost, the ever changing forest seems to be playing mind games with them.
- Suddenly they hear a scream and rush towards it, they find a small cultist camp with a magical hell fire burning in the middle of it. With a few cultists surrounding the fire, performing a ritual.
- Clanger sneakily approaches the camp, changes his voice to a devil's and speaks to the cultists in infernal while remaining in the shadows. Allowing him to successfully bluff the cultists who then reveal they have [[Dragur Moon]] in their possession whose soul has been put inside a stick and they are bringing him to hell through the portal.
- Clanger asks one of the cultists to bring Dragur with him and into a tent, so the the devil can take it with him instead. The cultist follows this command and Clanger sneakily takes the stick from the cultist without the cultist the even realizing.
- Clanger then asks all the cultists to leave through the portal except the one he talked to, After everyone leaves, Clanger and P'mis confront him but he breaks the [[Oath of Ragnar]] and dies.
- Clanger talks to Dragur about what happened, who tells him that on the day he got captured at the [[Alteka Family]] Manor, he was put in the dungeons below the manor, where he lived for a long time even after the collapse of the manor as no one could find him, one day the cultists found him and put his soul into the stick, he was able to fight back a bit and leave a message for Clanger.
- P'mis while looking around the camp finds a peculiar spell book which Dragur instantly learns spells from, showing that he somehow has very high aptitude for magic and arcana.
- With the help of Dragur, Clanger and P'mis are able to leave the forest and return back to [[Waterdeep]].
- P'mis then heads back to the [[Trollskull Manor]], while Clanger goes to [[Penelope Titlivlus]] and takes her to [[The Miragefall]]. Where she can be safe, Penelope quickly takes liking to the sauna area of the manor as she likes the heat and removes the water from the sauna and lives there now.
- The next day P'mis and Clanger go to the Guild hall for some work where they are approached by a member of [[The Dawn of Freedom Party]] who tells them that a well has been poisoned in the [[Dock Ward]] and an investigation is needed.
- P'mis and Clanger reach the well to find it belongs to the local church of [[Bahamut]], the party decides to interrogate the priest of the church who is a kobold, the priest is very suspicious during the investigation and keep insisting the party go check out a certain house near the church for some reason.
- The party decide to employ the services of a cleric from the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] and come back with [[Ronald]] a cleric who casts circle of truth on the priest who avoids it.
- Clanger thus deciding to call in a guard as the priest was very suspicious at this point goes and find a guard. On the sight of the guard, the priest transforms into a devil showing his true form and breaks the [[Oath of Ragnar]] and kills himself.
- The party then decides to check the house which the priest wanted them to check, to find an old lady living inside, P'mis using his *Divine Sense* discerns that she is also a devil in disguise.
- Clanger then decides to bluff the devil into thinking he is a devil too by changing his voice and gets the information that the well's poison is control by a magic crystal in the possession of the priest.
- The party then swiftly kills the devil and purify the well using the crystal, Clanger finds an [[Infernal Dagger]] inside the house that the other devil was occupying.
- The party then tells the guard to keep a tight security on the area and make sure no other cultists or devils sneak in, the guard seemingly annoyed by such a request says to Clanger that he can give Clanger 100000 gold if he doesn't report the matter to the higher ups and the the guard chill around.
- Taken aback by this and furious, Clanger heads directly for the City Guards HQ to complaint about the guard, he makes a sketch of the guard to show.
- When Clanger meets the chief who is named [[Magnus Dragonshield]] who tells Clanger that the person in the sketch belongs to [[Thomas Crook]], and even if he fires him there are too many corrupt guards in the city and he cannot do anything about it.
- Magnus adds that he is not provided with enough funds from the city and doesn't have enough personnel to be firing the corrupt ones. And he doesn't have much control over the guards even as the chief.
- Clanger leaves angrily realizing he needs to change much in the city. P'mis takes his leaves and goes back to the [[Trollskull Manor]].
