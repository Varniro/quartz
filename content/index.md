## [[Shoa]]
**Druid (Circle of Hybrid) | Wood Elf**

He grew up in a forest having to hunt to survive. At some point in his childhood the connection to the forest and the animals started to grow. He noticed that when a small bird told him that there was a deer that was dying and wished to be freed from his suffering. After that he started to learn a bit of his connection to the animals from them and he helped to keep the smaller ones safe from larger predators. He entered Waterdeep to see what the world outside the forest was like as he only saw them enter and heard the city during the day if he was close.

## [[P'mis]]
**Paladin (Unknown Oath) | Kobold**

P'mis, a kobold orphan constantly mocked and bullied, was orphaned after a bandit attack on his hovel and subsequently became a lackey for marauding orcs and goblins. After their defeat, he was captured by a band of paladins from the Order of the Gauntlet, who spared him and offered him a place in Waterdeep. There, P'mis performed menial tasks for the Order until he met and was mentored by the kind paladin Sir Alistair. Following Sir Alistair’s tragic death at the hands of his former captors, the Order, honoring Sir Alistair's faith in him, elevated P'mis to paladin status. Though unsure of his own worthiness, P'mis embraced his new role, driven by the values and memory of his mentor.

## [[Clanger Agundar]]
**Rogue (Mastermind) | Kenku**

Clanger, a Kenku abandoned as a hatchling in Waterdeep's Dock Ward, was adopted by the progressive and compassionate House Agundar. Named for the distinctive sound he made, Clanger grew up in privilege but faced widespread discrimination due to his race's ancient curse. Despite this, the Agundars provided him with a top-notch education, honing his talents in mimicry and creativity. Trained in self-defense by the ex-thief Silas the Shadowblade, Clanger used his skills to support the Dock Ward’s residents, earning their respect and admiration. His commitment to social reform led him to join the Dawn of Freedom (DoF) party, run for office, and win a position as one of the youngest officials in Waterdeep. As he works to improve conditions in his district, Clanger must also navigate a political storm and uncover the identity of a shadowy figure known as "The Phantom," whose actions threaten the stability of both the city and Clanger’s own quest to understand his origins.
